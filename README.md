# Week 8 Homework: Updated Portfolio
My solution, hosted using Github Pages: https://raven-bootcamp.github.io/week8-homework-portfolio/

The repository with my code: https://github.com/raven-bootcamp/week8-homework-portfolio

## The Task
Now that we have had some practice with APIs and have a project to share, we are to update our portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer-competitive.

Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is necessary if you're applying for jobs, but it's also critical on your journey as a developer.  

## My Approach
My old portfolio from week 2's homework wasn't quite good enough for where I wanted it to be, so I decided to redo the entire thing using the Bulma CSS framework to try it out.

## Requirements

```
- Updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.
- Updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.
- Updated resume
- Updated LinkedIn profile
```
