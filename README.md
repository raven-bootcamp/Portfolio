# Week 8 Homework: Updated Portfolio
My solution, hosted using Github Pages: https://raven-bootcamp.github.io/Portfolio/

The repository with my code: https://github.com/raven-bootcamp/Portfolio

## The Task
Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is necessary if you're applying for jobs, but it's also critical on your journey as a developer.  

## My Approach
I have opted for a traditional HTML approach, making use of the Bulma CSS framework.  

Future iterations of the portfolio will be upgraded to use React.

## Requirements

- Updated portfolio featuring at least 3 examples of student work from either deployed projects of homeworks
- Update GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring at least 3 examples of student work from either deployed projects of homeworks
- Updated resume
- Updated LinkedIn profile
